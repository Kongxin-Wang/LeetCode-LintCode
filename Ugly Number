/*
LeetCode 263:
Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. For example, 6, 8 are ugly while 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7.

Note that 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.

    bool isUgly(int num) {

        // 1. loop
        int factors[3] = {2, 3, 5};
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
            while (num % factors[i] == 0) {
                num /= factors[i];
            }
        }
        return (num == 1);
